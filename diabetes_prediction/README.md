# diabetesprediction
I use a logistic regression algorithm and a machine learning technique.
About my prototype:
Diabetes is one of the worst diseases there is. Obesity, a high blood glucose level, and other factors can cause diabetes.
It alters the function of the hormone insulin, which causes crabs to have an irregular metabolism and raises blood sugar levels. When the body does not produce enough insulin, diabetes develops.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, mostly in low- or middle-income nations. And up until the year 2030, this might be increased to 490 billion.
However, diabetes is more common in many nations, including Canada, China, and India, among others.
